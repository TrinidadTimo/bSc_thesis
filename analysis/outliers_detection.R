### I'm setting
#### - n_min = 2 (minimal number to fit a line - default value and also what seems to be used regularly [https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/322812/ransac-should-we-always-sample-with-the-minimal-number-of-data-points])
### For the tolerance threshold I'm using my bootstrapped distribution again:

residual_range <- upper - lower
threshold_boot <- mean(residual_range) # Threshold is given as the mean of the 95% intervals of the conditional residual distributions.

fit_ransac <- ransac_reg(IAVAR_GPP ~ IAVAR_NBP, data = df, n_min = 2, tol = threshold_boot)

nrow(fit_ransac$model) # -> 5 models as outliers excluded
summary(fit_ransac) # R^2 = 0.5769

df_ransac_fit <- df %>%
  mutate(Inlier = if_else(df$IAVAR_GPP %in% fit_ransac$model$IAVAR_GPP, "Inlier", "Outlier"))

ggplot(data= df_ransac_fit, aes(x = IAVAR_GPP, y =  IAVAR_NBP, color = Inlier)) +
  geom_point()

plot(fit_ransac)
